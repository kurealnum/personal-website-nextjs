                I started my formal education with Harvard&apos;s CS50 when I
                was 15, which gave me a proper starting point for software
                development. I began with Non-Profit Link, a web application for
                the non-profits in my area, now used by dog shelters in South
                Africa. I then created RDI (React-Django-Implementation), which
                I used to help create byeAI, a blogging site for developers that
                strictly disallows AI generated content.

                In terms of academics, I&apos;ve taken 4 dual enrollment IT
                classes (all CompTIA based) as well as 4 AP classes, only in the
                last two years of highschool. I scored a 5 on AP Calc AB, AP
                Computer Science A, and AP Computer Science Principles. I&apos;m
                also currently maintaining a 4.0 @ UMW.
